# NagasPilot Safety

NagasPilot is an enhanced autonomous driving system built on OpenPilot's proven safety foundation. Like other Level 2 Driver Assistance Systems, NagasPilot is a failsafe passive system that **requires the driver to remain alert and attentive at all times**.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Enhanced Safety Architecture**

NagasPilot extends OpenPilot's safety model with additional safety layers while maintaining all original safety requirements:

### **Foundation Safety Principles**
1. **Driver Override Priority**: Manual intervention (steering, braking, acceleration) always takes immediate control
2. **Trajectory Constraints**: All actuators operate within safe limits for driver reaction time
3. **Graceful Degradation**: System safely falls back to OpenPilot behavior on any failure
4. **Independent Fallback**: Revolutionary granular control allows selective system disabling

### **NagasPilot Safety Hierarchy** (Highest to Lowest Priority)
```
1. üî¥ Manual Driver Intervention / Emergency Brake Override
2. üü† SOC Collision Avoidance (Independent lateral positioning)
3. üü° EODS Emergency Detection (Enhanced obstacle detection)
4. üü¢ Master Safety System Override
5. üîµ Speed Controllers (VTSC/MTSC/VCSC curve and comfort limits)
6. üü£ Performance Systems (PDA overtaking with TTC safety)
7. ‚ö™ Learning Systems (APSL/BPSL dual-pedal adaptation)
8. ‚ö´ Base Control (DCP/DLP foundation operation)
```

## üîí **Multi-Layer Safety Systems**

### **Enhanced Safety Controllers**
- **SOC (Smart Offset Controller)**: Independent vehicle avoidance with acceleration safety checks (>2.0 m/s¬≤)
- **EODS (Enhanced Obstacle Detection)**: Real-time people and obstacle detection using YOLOv8
- **NDLOB (No Disengage Lateral On Brake)**: Maintains lane keeping during emergency braking
- **PDA (Parallel Drive Avoidance)**: TTC-based overtaking safety (6s/4s/2.5s thresholds)

### **Revolutionary Independent Fallback Control**
**World's First Granular Autopilot Safety Matrix:**

| DCP Mode ‚Üì | DLP Mode ‚Üí | Mode 0 (Off) | Mode > 0 (Enhanced) |
|------------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Mode 0 (Off)** | | üî¥ **Complete Fallback**<br>100% OpenPilot Behavior | üü° **Lateral Only**<br>Stock Cruise + Enhanced Steering |
| **Mode > 0 (Enhanced)** | | üü° **Longitudinal Only**<br>Enhanced Cruise + Stock Steering | üü¢ **Full Enhancement**<br>All Systems Active |

**Safety Benefit**: Users can instantly disable problematic systems while maintaining other enhancements.

- **Override Time**: Manual interventions take effect within hardware limits

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Safety Requirements & Limitations**

### **Driver Responsibilities**
1. **Constant Attention**: Driver must remain alert and ready to take control
2. **Hand Position**: Hands must be ready to steer (HOD system provides monitoring)
3. **Visual Monitoring**: Driver must continuously monitor road conditions
4. **System Understanding**: Driver must understand system capabilities and limitations

### **Operational Safety Limits**
- **Speed Range**: System operates within OpenPilot's proven speed limits
- **Weather Conditions**: Performance degrades in low visibility conditions
- **Road Types**: Enhanced features designed for highway and major road use
- **Vehicle Compatibility**: Limited to OpenPilot-supported vehicles

### **Enhanced Safety Features**
- **Hands-Off Duration (HOD)**: Configurable timeout system (2min/5min/10min/Forever)
- **Stand Still Duration (SSD)**: Prevents unintended acceleration after stops
- **Learning Override Detection**: APSL/BPSL systems detect manual interventions
- **Progressive Warning System**: Multi-stage alerts before safety interventions

## üîß **Safety Configuration**

### **Conservative Default Settings**
NagasPilot ships with conservative safety settings that can be adjusted based on experience:

```python
# Foundation Safety Settings
"np_dcp_mode" = 1          # Start with Highway mode (conservative)
"np_dlp_mode" = 1          # Start with Laneless mode (proven)

# Speed Controller Safety
"np_vtsc_enabled" = True   # Vision-based safety (conservative speed reduction)
"np_mtsc_enabled" = False  # Map-based (disable until map data validated)
"np_vcsc_enabled" = True   # Comfort-based (improves ride quality)

# Safety System Settings
"np_soc_enabled" = True    # Independent vehicle avoidance (recommended)
"np_hod_duration_level" = 0 # 2-minute hands-off timeout (conservative)
"np_ssd_duration_level" = 0 # 2-minute standstill timeout (conservative)
```

### **Advanced User Settings**
Experienced users may enable additional features with proper understanding:
- **Extended HOD**: Longer hands-off durations for highway driving
- **Performance Features**: PDA overtaking with TTC safety validation
