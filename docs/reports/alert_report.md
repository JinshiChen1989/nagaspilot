## Alert Processing Flow

### 1. Event Generation
```python
# Events generated by various subsystems:
# selfdrive/controls/controlsd.py - Vehicle control events  
# selfdrive/monitoring/dmonitoringd.py - Driver monitoring
# selfdrive/locationd/calibrationd.py - Calibration events
# system daemons (hardwared, sensord, etc.) - Hardware monitoring
```

### 2. Event Collection
**File**: [`selfdrive/selfdrived/events.py:Events class`](../selfdrive/selfdrived/events.py#L50)
- Collects events from all subsystems
- Manages event priorities and conflicts
- Determines active event set

### 3. Alert Generation  
**File**: [`selfdrive/selfdrived/alertmanager.py:AlertManager class`](../selfdrive/selfdrived/alertmanager.py#L15)
- Converts events to displayable alerts
- Handles alert timing and duration
- Manages alert audio/visual properties

### 4. UI Display
**Onroad**: [`selfdrive/ui/qt/onroad/alerts.cc`](../selfdrive/ui/qt/onroad/alerts.cc) - Active driving alerts
**Offroad**: [`selfdrive/ui/qt/widgets/offroad_alerts.cc`](../selfdrive/ui/qt/widgets/offroad_alerts.cc) - System setup alerts

## Testing and Debug Tools

### Alert Testing
- **Alert Cycle Tool**: [`selfdrive/debug/cycle_alerts.py`](../selfdrive/debug/cycle_alerts.py)
- **Alert Tests**: [`selfdrive/selfdrived/tests/test_alerts.py`](../selfdrive/selfdrived/tests/test_alerts.py)
- **Offroad Alert Tests**: [`selfdrive/ui/tests/cycle_offroad_alerts.py`](../selfdrive/ui/tests/cycle_offroad_alerts.py)

### Manual Alert Triggering (for testing)
```bash
# Trigger specific alert for testing
python selfdrive/debug/cycle_alerts.py --alert speedTooHigh
```

## Alert Configuration

### Customizing Alerts
Alert behavior can be modified by editing:
- **`events.py`** - Alert definitions and conditions
- **`alerts_offroad.json`** - Offroad alert configuration  
- **Translation files** - Alert text in different languages

### Alert Priority System
1. **HIGHEST**: Critical safety alerts (overheat, can error)
2. **HIGH**: Driver monitoring alerts  
3. **MID**: System warnings
4. **LOW**: Informational messages
5. **LOWEST**: Background status
