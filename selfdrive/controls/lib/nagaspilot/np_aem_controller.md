# NP_AEM_CONTROLLER - Adaptive Experimental Mode Controller

## Overview
**File**: `selfdrive/controls/lib/nagaspilot/aem.py`  
**Purpose**: Intelligent switching between ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) and Blended longitudinal control modes based on real-time driving context analysis and traffic conditions.  
**Integration**: Core component of DCP (Dynamic Control Profile) system for optimal longitudinal control mode selection.

## Core Functionality

### Primary Features
- **Dynamic Mode Selection**: Automatic switching between ACC and Blended control modes
- **Speed-Based Context Classification**: Highway, City, Low Speed, and Creep mode detection
- **Lead Vehicle Analysis**: Real-time TTC (Time To Collision) calculations and traffic assessment
- **Traffic Density Assessment**: Optimal control mode selection based on driving conditions
- **Smooth Transitions**: Prevents jarring mode changes through filtered switching logic

### Operational Logic
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ HIGHWAY (>80kph): Prefer ACC for efficiency and comfort         │
│ CITY (20-80kph): Dynamic switching based on traffic conditions │  
│ LOW SPEED (<20kph): Prefer Blended for precise control         │
│ CREEP (<8kph): Always Blended for stop-and-go traffic         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Technical Implementation

### Speed Classification Thresholds
```python
SPEED_THRESHOLD_HIGHWAY = 22.23  # m/s (≈80 kph)
SPEED_THRESHOLD_CITY = 15.27     # m/s (≈55 kph)
SPEED_THRESHOLD_LOW = 5.56       # m/s (≈20 kph)
SPEED_THRESHOLD_CREEP = 2.23     # m/s (≈8 kph)
```

### Lead Vehicle Safety Parameters
```python
LEAD_TTC_CRITICAL = 1.75        # seconds, critical time to collision
LEAD_TTC_CAUTION = 3.0          # seconds, caution time to collision
LEAD_DIST_VERY_CLOSE = 10.0     # meters
LEAD_DIST_FAR_HIGHWAY = 85.0    # meters, highway following distance
```

### Control Timing and Hysteresis
```python
HYSTERESIS_FRAMES_TO_SWITCH = 10       # ~0.5s at 20Hz for mode switching
LEAD_LOST_FRAMES_TO_FALLBACK_BASE = 40 # ~2s at 20Hz for lead loss
```

## Decision Factors

### Context Analysis
1. **Vehicle Speed Classification**: Determines base operating context
2. **Lead Vehicle Distance**: Analyzes following distance and closure rate
3. **Traffic Density Detection**: Assesses flow patterns for optimal mode
4. **Time-to-Collision Safety**: Real-time collision risk calculations
5. **Historical Performance**: Learns from similar driving conditions

### Mode Selection Logic
- **Highway Speed**: Favors ACC for fuel efficiency and comfort
- **City Speed**: Dynamic switching based on traffic density and lead behavior
- **Low Speed**: Prefers Blended for precise control and responsiveness
- **Creep Speed**: Always uses Blended for stop-and-go traffic management
