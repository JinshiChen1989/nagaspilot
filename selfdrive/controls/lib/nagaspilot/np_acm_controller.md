# NP_ACM_CONTROLLER - Adaptive Coasting Mode Controller

## Overview
**File**: `selfdrive/controls/lib/nagaspilot/acm.py`  
**Purpose**: Intelligent downhill coasting functionality that allows controlled speed increase on downhill slopes without unnecessary braking, improving efficiency and driving comfort.  
**Integration**: Core component of DCP (Dynamic Control Profile) system for energy-efficient longitudinal control.

## Core Functionality

### Primary Features
- **Slope Detection**: Real-time gradient analysis for downhill identification
- **Speed Management**: Controlled speed increase management on descents
- **Lead Vehicle Awareness**: Safe following distance maintenance during coasting
- **TTC-Based Safety**: Time-to-collision monitoring for collision avoidance
- **Energy-Efficient Coasting**: Selective brake application for optimal efficiency

### Operational Logic
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ DOWNHILL DETECTION: Slope < -4% threshold triggers coasting     │
│ SPEED MANAGEMENT: Allow 10% speed increase above cruise setting │
│ LEAD SAFETY: Maintain TTC > 3.5s for safe following           │
│ BRAKE MODULATION: Selective brake application based on context │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Technical Implementation

### Core Configuration Parameters
```python
SLOPE = -0.04  # Minimum downhill slope to activate (-4%)
RATIO = 0.9    # Speed ratio threshold for activation
TTC = 3.5      # Minimum safe TTC for lead vehicle (seconds)
```

### Safety Parameters
```python
TTC_BP = [TTC, 2.5]              # TTC breakpoints for brake control
MIN_BRAKE_ALLOW_VALS = [0., -0.5] # Brake application limits
```

### State Management
```python
class ACM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Configuration parameters
        self.enabled = False          # ACM system enable state
        self.downhill_only = False    # Restrict to downhill only
        
        # State tracking
        self._is_downhill = False     # Current slope state
        self._is_speed_over_cruise = False  # Speed vs cruise comparison
        self._has_lead = False        # Lead vehicle presence
        
        # Control state  
        self.active = False           # ACM currently active
        self.allowed_brake_val = 0.0  # Current brake limit
```
