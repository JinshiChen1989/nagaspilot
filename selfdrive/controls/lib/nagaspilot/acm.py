NAGASPILOT ACM (ADAPTIVE CRUISE MODE) - DOWNHILL COASTING SYSTEM
====================================================================

OVERVIEW:
ACM implements intelligent downhill coasting functionality that allows the 
vehicle to maintain or slightly increase speed on downhill slopes without 
unnecessary braking, improving efficiency and driving comfort.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- Slope detection and gradient analysis for downhill identification
- Speed management that allows controlled speed increase on descents
- Lead vehicle awareness to maintain safe following distances
- Time-to-collision (TTC) based safety monitoring
- Energy-efficient coasting with selective brake application

OPERATIONAL LOGIC:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ DOWNHILL DETECTION: Slope < -4% threshold triggers coasting     │
│ SPEED MANAGEMENT: Allow 10% speed increase above cruise setting │
│ LEAD SAFETY: Maintain TTC > 3.5s for safe following           │
│ BRAKE MODULATION: Selective brake application based on context │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

SAFETY FEATURES:
- TTC-based collision avoidance with lead vehicles
- Configurable slope thresholds for activation
- Speed ratio limits to prevent excessive acceleration
- Lead vehicle detection and proximity monitoring
- Conservative brake application when safety margins approached

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- OpenPilot longitudinal control for cruise management
- Slope estimation from vehicle dynamics and GPS data
- Lead vehicle tracking from vision model
- Brake system integration for seamless control

EFFICIENCY BENEFITS:
- Reduced unnecessary braking on downhill sections
- Improved energy efficiency through regenerative coasting
- Smoother driving experience with natural speed management
- Optimized for highway and mountain driving scenarios
