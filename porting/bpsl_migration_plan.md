## üéØ Concept Overview

**BPSL completes the dual-pedal speed learning system alongside APSL, enabling natural speed adjustment using both acceleration and braking behavior.**

**Core Concept**: When driver releases brake pedal after manual deceleration, BPSL learns the final achieved speed as new cruise target.

## üöó Dual-Pedal Speed Learning System

### **APSL + BPSL Integration**
```
Driver Speed Control:
‚îú‚îÄ Want FASTER speed ‚Üí Gas pedal ‚Üí APSL learns higher target
‚îî‚îÄ Want SLOWER speed ‚Üí Brake pedal ‚Üí BPSL learns lower target

Both work as DCP filters with seamless coordination
```

### **Natural Driver Behavior**
- **Acceleration Learning**: Press gas to 75 mph, release ‚Üí APSL learns 75 mph
- **Deceleration Learning**: Brake to 55 mph, release ‚Üí BPSL learns 55 mph
- **Manual Override**: Either pedal temporarily overrides, learns on release

---

## üìã BPSL Core Functions

### **Function 1: Learn Speed from Brake Release**
```python
# Core BPSL Learning Logic
if brake_pressed and not system_braking: start_deceleration_learning()
if brake_released and learning_active: learn_final_speed_if_significant_decrease()
```

### **Function 2: Distinguish Manual vs System Braking**
- **Manual Braking**: Driver intentionally slowing down ‚Üí Learn new target
- **System Braking**: Lead car/safety braking ‚Üí Don't learn, maintain target
- **Detection**: Monitor brake pressure, lead car distance, driver behavior patterns

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design

### **DCP Filter Integration**
```
DCP Filter Priority Order (Real-World ADAS Safety Hierarchy):
 100: VTSC (Vision Turn Speed Controller)   ‚Üê Highest: Immediate visual hazards
  90: MTSC (Map Turn Speed Controller)      ‚Üê High: Map-based safety warnings
  80: BPSL (Brake Pedal Speed Learning)     ‚Üê Driver brake intent (respects safety)
  70: APSL (Accelerator Pedal Speed Learning) ‚Üê Driver acceleration intent
   5: PDA (Parallel Drive Avoidance)        ‚Üê Overtaking only when safe
   3: VCSC (Vertical Comfort Speed Controller) ‚Üê Comfort adjustments
```

### **Real-World ADAS Safety Rationale**
**Priority Design Principles:**
1. **Vision Hazards (100)**: Highest priority - immediate safety threats from camera
2. **Map Safety (90)**: High priority - map-based curve and hazard warnings
3. **Driver Brake Intent (80)**: Respect driver's safety-oriented braking decisions
4. **Driver Acceleration Intent (70)**: Respect driver's speed preferences when safe
5. **Overtaking Strategy (5)**: Performance enhancement only when all safety allows
6. **Comfort (3)**: Lowest priority - comfort adjustments never override safety

### **APSL + BPSL Coordination**
```python
class DualPedalSpeedLearning:
    def coordinate_learning(self, apsl_target, bpsl_target):
        # BPSL always wins due to higher priority (999 vs 50)
        # Brake input represents safety-critical driver intent
        if bpsl_target and bpsl_learning_active:
            return bpsl_target  # Brake learning takes precedence
        elif apsl_target and apsl_learning_active:
            return apsl_target  # Gas learning when no brake input
        return base_speed       # Fallback to system default
```

## üìù Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: BPSL Controller Design** 
**Objective**: Create np_bpsl_controller.py with brake learning logic

**Key Features**:
- Brake pedal position monitoring
- Manual vs system brake detection
- Speed learning on brake release
- DCP filter integration (priority 999)

**Detection Logic**:
```python
def is_manual_braking(self, driving_context):
    # Not manual if:
    if has_lead_car_close(): return False
    if emergency_braking_active(): return False  
    if following_distance_braking(): return False
    
    # Manual if driver-initiated deceleration
    return brake_pressure > MANUAL_THRESHOLD
```

### **Phase 2: APSL + BPSL Coordination**
**Objective**: Seamless integration between acceleration and deceleration learning

**Coordination Features**:
- Timestamp-based priority (most recent wins)
- Smooth transition between learned targets
- Prevent learning conflicts
- Unified speed learning telemetry

### **Phase 3: Advanced Brake Detection**
**Objective**: Intelligent detection of manual vs system braking

**Detection Methods**:
- **Lead Car Analysis**: Distance, relative speed, closing rate
- **Safety System Integration**: FCW, AEB, following distance
- **Driver Pattern Recognition**: Brake pressure curves, timing
- **Multi-Modal Detection**: Vision + radar + driver behavior

### **Phase 4: UI/UX Integration**
**Objective**: Provide clear feedback for dual-pedal learning

**User Experience**:
- Visual confirmation of speed learning (gas/brake)
- Display current learned target and source (APSL/BPSL)
- Settings for learning sensitivity and detection thresholds

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### **Basic Learning Tests**
1. **APSL Learning**: 60‚Üí75 mph acceleration, release ‚Üí learns 75 mph
2. **BPSL Learning**: 75‚Üí60 mph manual braking, release ‚Üí learns 60 mph
3. **Coordination**: APSL then BPSL ‚Üí BPSL target wins (most recent)

### **Detection Accuracy Tests**
1. **Manual Brake**: Driver braking on empty road ‚Üí Should learn
2. **Lead Car Brake**: System braking for lead car ‚Üí Should NOT learn
3. **Emergency Brake**: FCW/AEB activation ‚Üí Should NOT learn
4. **Following Distance**: Routine following brake ‚Üí Should NOT learn

### **Real-World Scenarios**
1. **Highway Speed Adjustment**: 70‚Üí65 mph zone change via braking
2. **Traffic Flow**: Manual speed reduction for traffic conditions
3. **Curve Approach**: Driver braking before curve (coordinate with VTSC)
