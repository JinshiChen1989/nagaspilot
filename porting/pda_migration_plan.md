## **Implementation Details**

### **Architecture**
```
PDA Controller ‚Üí Anchor Car Detection ‚Üí Safety Checks ‚Üí Speed Boost ‚Üí DCP
               ‚Üó TTC Monitoring (front car)
               ‚Üó Gap Distance Validation
               ‚Üó SOC Status Communication
               ‚Üó Conservative Speed Limits
```

### **State Machine**
```python
class PDAState(IntEnum):
    DISABLED = 0      # PDA disabled or dependency not met  
    MONITORING = 1    # Watching for anchor cars
    DETECTING = 2     # Anchor car detected, analyzing lead vehicle safety
    SMART_BOOSTING = 3 # Intelligent acceleration based on lead vehicle analysis
    COOLDOWN = 4      # Gap time after boost (prevent continuous boosting)
```

### **Key Safety Features**
1. **TTC Safety Monitoring**: Continuous Time-To-Collision validation before/during boost
2. **Gap Distance Validation**: Minimum 30m front car distance with 15m safety margin
3. **Conservative Boost**: 5-10 km/h speed increase, never exceed target cruise speed
4. **Anchor Duration**: Requires 5-second minimum anchor car detection
5. **Cooldown Period**: 10-second gap between boosts prevents continuous operation

## **Safety Features**

### **TTC (Time To Collision) Monitoring** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
```python
def calculate_ttc(self, distance: float, ego_speed_ms: float, lead_speed_ms: float) -> float:
    """Calculate Time To Collision with lead vehicle"""
    relative_speed = ego_speed_ms - lead_speed_ms
    
    if distance > 0.1 and relative_speed > 0.3:
        return max(0.0, distance / relative_speed)
    
    return float('inf')  # No collision course

def check_ttc_safety(self, driving_context: Dict[str, Any], ego_speed_ms: float) -> Dict:
    """Three-tier TTC safety validation"""
    # Critical: 2.5s, Continue: 4.0s, Safe: 6.0s
```

### **Conservative Overtaking Logic** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
```python
def check_safe_overtaking(self, v_ego: float, target_speed: float, anchor_speed: float) -> Optional[float]:
    """Check all conditions for safe overtaking"""
    # 1. Anchor car slower than target cruise speed
    # 2. Front car enough safety distance (30m min)
    # 3. Won't need brake after passing
    # 4. Never over target cruise speed
```

## **Integration Points**

### **File Structure** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
```
/selfdrive/controls/lib/nagaspilot/np_pda_controller.py  (Single file implementation)
```

### **Dependencies** ‚úÖ **VALIDATED**
- **DCP Foundation**: Requires Dynamic Control Profile active
- **ModelV2 LeadsV3**: Uses lead vehicle detection for anchor car analysis
- **TTC Integration**: Uses same TTC calculation as AEM for consistency
- **Parameter System**: All parameters use np_ prefix

### **SOC Coordination** ‚úÖ **WORKING**
```python
# PDA communicates status for SOC safety coordination
driving_context['pda_status'] = {
    'active': is_boost_active,
    'reason': 'boost' if is_boost_active else 'monitoring'
}
```

## **Parameters**

### **Core PDA Parameters**
```python

("np_pda_min_boost_kmh", "5.0"),             # Minimum boost (5 km/h)
("np_pda_max_boost_kmh", "10.0"),            # Maximum boost (10 km/h)
```

### **Safety Parameters**

# TTC Safety Thresholds
self.ttc_safe_boost = 6.0            # Minimum TTC to start boost
self.ttc_continue_boost = 4.0        # Minimum TTC to continue boost  
self.ttc_critical = 2.5              # Critical TTC - abort immediately

# Distance & Timing
self.min_safe_distance = 30.0        # Minimum safe distance to front car
self.safety_margin = 15.0            # Extra margin after overtaking
self.anchor_min_duration = 5.0       # Anchor must exist for 5+ seconds
self.boost_duration = 8.0            # Maximum boost duration
self.cooldown_duration = 10.0        # Gap time between boosts
```

### **Dependency Parameters**
```python
("np_dcp_mode", ">0"),               # Requires DCP foundation active
