 read vrc_migration_plan.md dlp_migration_plan.md big_picture_plan.md then start to implement VRC feature and keep tracking everystep at vrc_migration_track.md same folder, think hard try to
   minimize changes to codebase.

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants me to:
  1. Read three files: vrc_migration_plan.md, dlp_migration_plan.md, and big_picture_plan.md
  2. Start implementing VRC feature based on these plans
  3. Track every step at vrc_migration_track.md in the same folder
  4. Try to minimize changes to the codebase

  This is a complex task that would benefit from a todo list. I need to first read the files to understand what needs to be done, then create a plan for implementation.

  Let me first read the three files to understand the context and requirements.

● I'll read the migration plans and implement the VRC feature while tracking progress. Let me start by reading the files to understand the requirements.

● Read(vrc_migration_plan.md)
  ⎿  Error: File does not exist.

● Read(dlp_migration_plan.md)
  ⎿  Error: File does not exist.

● Read(big_picture_plan.md)
  ⎿  Error: File does not exist.

✻ Thinking…

  The files don't exist. Let me check what files are in the current directory and see if these migration plan files are in a different location.

● Let me check what migration plan files exist in the directory:

● Search(pattern: "*migration_plan.md")
  ⎿  Found 0 files

✻ Thinking…

  Let me look at the current directory to see what's available, and also check if there are any migration-related files.

● List(.)
  ⎿  Listed 1415 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

● Search(pattern: "**/*migration*.md")
  ⎿  Found 35 files (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I found the migration plan files! They are in the porting directory. Let me read the three files mentioned by the user:

  1. vrc_migration_plan.md - located at /home/vcar/Winsurf/nagaspilot/porting/vrc_migration_plan.md
  2. dlp_migration_plan.md - located at /home/vcar/Winsurf/nagaspilot/porting/dlp_migration_plan.md
  3. big_picture_plan.md - located at /home/vcar/Winsurf/nagaspilot/porting/big_picture_plan.md

  Let me read these files first.

● Read(porting/vrc_migration_plan.md)
  ⎿  Read 932 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(porting/dlp_migration_plan.md)
  ⎿  Read 1642 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(porting/big_picture_plan.md)
  ⎿  Read 371 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have read all three files. Let me understand what these plans are about:

  1. vrc_migration_plan.md - VRC (Vehicle Roll Controller) for lateral acceleration safety control through steering yaw rate limitation. It's a safety controller that prevents excessive
  lateral forces by limiting steering commands.
  2. dlp_migration_plan.md - DLP (Dynamic Lane Profile) foundation for lateral control in NagasPilot. This is about enhancing the lateral control system with laneless vs lane-following modes.
  3. big_picture_plan.md - A comprehensive coordination plan that resolves conflicts between all migration plans and establishes a foundation + layers architecture.

  From reading these plans, I can see that:
  - VRC is a safety controller that limits steering to prevent excessive lateral acceleration
  - DLP is the foundation lateral control system
  - The big picture plan coordinates all systems in a foundation + layers architecture
  - There's a Phase 1 (foundation) and Phase 2 (enhancement layers) approach

  The user wants me to:
  1. Start implementing VRC feature based on these plans
  2. Track every step at vrc_migration_track.md in the same folder
  3. Try to minimize changes to codebase

  I need to:
  1. Create a todo list for implementing VRC
  2. Start implementing the VRC feature step by step
  3. Track progress in vrc_migration_track.md

  Let me first create a todo list based on the VRC migration plan.

● I'll start implementing the VRC (Vehicle Roll Controller) feature based on the migration plans. Let me create a todo list to track the implementation progress.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Create vrc_migration_track.md to track implementation progress
     ☐ Analyze existing codebase structure for VRC integration points
     ☐ Implement VehicleRollController class (vehicle_roll_controller.py)
     ☐ Integrate VRC with lateral_planner.py (8 lines of changes)
     ☐ Add VRC message protocol fields (@44-@46) to cereal/custom.capnp
     ☐ Add VRC parameters to system manager (6 parameters)
     ☐ Test VRC lateral acceleration monitoring functionality
     ☐ Test VRC steering limitation functionality
     ☐ Validate VRC safety hierarchy and fallback behavior
     ☐ Create comprehensive test documentation

✻ Thinking…

  Now I'll start implementing the VRC feature. Let me start with the first task - creating the tracking file.

● Let me start implementing VRC. First, I'll create the tracking file and begin analyzing the codebase structure.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Create vrc_migration_track.md to track implementation progress
     ☐ Analyze existing codebase structure for VRC integration points
     ☐ Implement VehicleRollController class (vehicle_roll_controller.py)

     ☐ Add VRC parameters to system manager (6 parameters)
     ☐ Test VRC lateral acceleration monitoring functionality
     ☐ Test VRC steering limitation functionality
     ☐ Validate VRC safety hierarchy and fallback behavior
     ☐ Create comprehensive test documentation

✻ Thinking…

  Now I'll create the tracking file in the porting directory to document the VRC implementation progress.

● Write(porting/vrc_migration_track.md)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I've created the tracking file. Now let me mark the first task as completed and move to the next task - analyzing the existing codebase structure.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Create vrc_migration_track.md to track implementation progress
     ☐ Analyze existing codebase structure for VRC integration points
     ☐ Implement VehicleRollController class (vehicle_roll_controller.py)
     ☐ Integrate VRC with lateral_planner.py (8 lines of changes)
     ☐ Add VRC message protocol fields (@44-@46) to cereal/custom.capnp

     ☐ Test VRC lateral acceleration monitoring functionality
     ☐ Test VRC steering limitation functionality
     ☐ Validate VRC safety hierarchy and fallback behavior
     ☐ Create comprehensive test documentation

✻ Thinking…

  Now I need to analyze the existing codebase structure to understand where to integrate VRC. Let me look at the lateral control files and nagaspilot structure.

● Let me analyze the existing codebase structure to find the best integration points for VRC:

● Search(pattern: "selfdrive/controls/lib/*lateral*")
  ⎿  Found 0 files

● Search(pattern: "selfdrive/controls/lib/nagaspilot/*")
  ⎿  Found 11 files (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Great! I found the nagaspilot structure. I can see there's already a lateral_planner.py in the nagaspilot directory, which is exactly what I need for VRC integration. Let me examine this
  file to understand the current lateral control structure.

● Read(selfdrive/controls/lib/nagaspilot/lateral_planner.py)
  ⎿  Read 334 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I can see that the lateral_planner.py already has the DLP foundation implemented, and it even has foundation status methods that are perfectly suited for VRC integration. Let me
  also check if there are any existing control files to understand the structure better.

● Search(pattern: "selfdrive/controls/lib/longitudinal_planner.py")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(cereal/custom.capnp)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I can see that the foundation is already there. The cereal/custom.capnp file already has the coordinated message protocol fields defined and VRC is mentioned for fields @44-@46.
  Let me continue reading the custom.capnp file to see the VRC fields.

● Read(cereal/custom.capnp)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I notice that the VRC fields (@44-@46) mentioned in the plan are not currently implemented in the custom.capnp file. The file only shows fields up to @31 for speed controllers, then it
  ends. This means I need to add the VRC fields as planned.

  Let me also check the system manager to see if VRC parameters already exist or need to be added.

● Search(pattern: "np_vrc")
  ⎿  Found 8 files (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Great! I found that VRC parameters are already referenced in params_keys.h and there's even a UI panel in np_panel.cc. Let me check these files to see what VRC infrastructure already
  exists.

● Search(pattern: "np_vrc", path: "common/params_keys.h", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Search(pattern: "VRC", path: "selfdrive/ui/qt/offroad/np_panel.cc", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 22 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Excellent! I can see that some VRC infrastructure already exists:

  1. params_keys.h has VRC parameters defined: np_vrc_enabled and np_vrc_lateral_accel_limit
  2. np_panel.cc has UI controls for VRC including:
    - VRC toggle
    - VRC Lateral Acceleration Limit
    - VRC Yaw Rate Limit

  However, I notice the implementation is not complete. Let me check what other VRC parameters exist and see if the actual VRC controller exists.

● Search(pattern: "np_vrc", path: "common/params_keys.h", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 9 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Search(pattern: "**/vehicle_roll_controller*")
  ⎿  Found 0 files

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I have a clear picture of the current VRC implementation status:

  CURRENT STATUS:
  - ✅ VRC Parameters: Exist in params_keys.h
  - ✅ VRC UI: Exists in np_panel.cc
  - ❌ VRC Controller: Does NOT exist (no vehicle_roll_controller.py found)
  - ❌ VRC Integration: Not integrated into lateral_planner.py
  - ❌ VRC Message Protocol: Fields @44-@46 not in custom.capnp

  This is perfect for minimal implementation! The infrastructure is already there, I just need to implement the core controller and integrate it.

  Let me update the tracking file and move to implementing the VRC controller.
